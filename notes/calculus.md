* Differentiation from the geometric sense is all about the secant approaching the tangent line as delta x tends to 0.

* The derivate is the slope of the tangent line.

* the common formula for derivate is lim delta x -> 0 (f(x + delta x) - f(x) ) / delta x.

* we do some geometrical proofs to prove that sinx has cosx as derivative and similarly for others.

* but for the general cases like the constant multiple rule, addition rule, product rule, quotient rule we can have 
  some intuition about their proofs using some geometry and algebra.

* For the constant multiple rule, where derivative of C*f(x) = C*f'(x) because as you can see from the function's 
  graph, multiplying it by a constant only scales all the y values the slope thereby also gets scaled. the direction
  of the tangent lines are same as the shape of the graph is same, only scaled.

* Likewise for the addition rule we can see that delta of h(x) where h(x) = f(x) + g(x) is delta f(x) + delta g(x)
  so the limit applies to them..

* Likewise for the product rule where (uv)' = uv' + vu', you can basically see it as changing one while the other is
  treated as a constant. why? because the delta uv can be seen as addition of new u constant * v change + v constant 
  + u change and as the next step take the limit of the delta.

* so to get the intuition the steps are 1. take the delta change 2. apply limit to it.

* continuitly is about the function f(x) where the left and right limits tend to the value at the point f(x).

* whereas differentiability is about f'(x) i.e the left and right limit of slopes tend to the same value. That is why
  visually we say a rough right angle or cut is not differentiable because left and right slopes tend to different
  values.
