## Timeless

* The first step is always the sample space, but what's interesting here is that you can just write down
  the outcomes in a set or you can draw a tree of all possible outcomes, essentially introducing a time
  component. And things may get confusing here. Because conditional probability problems on inference is
  essentially going backwards in time. Anyways, it is timeless and pure logic, but can be interpreted in
  time.

* Probabilties are just proportions. I like to think of proportions as proportions of what? so you get
  the what first, that is denominator the total parts, and then how much of it? the numerator.
  Following that logic, the conditional probability makes sense. You see, if the original sample space
  has p(a) = 2/6 and p(b) = 3/6, then p(a|b) = p(a intersection b)/p(b) that is 2/6 / 3/6 but why?
  IN proportional sense, all you are doing is saying that proportions of what? the what here is a 
  different universe now, which is a proportion in itself and the numerator is also a part of it.
  If you see both the numerator and denominator are in terms of the original universe or the what?
  Kind of like in linear algebra where you try to write different coordinate systems in the parent
  coordinate system. These conditional probabilities are the same, expressed in the parent terms.
  They are nothing but normal probabilities only conditioning which can be seen as in time when 
  you refer to it as someone giviing you partial info like hey I know that B happened, or it can
  be seen as timeless as pure logic where you describe the proportions in parent units.

* The intuition about things introduces time. Because we are used to it. That is why we call it inference.

* at the end of the day the only question in the timeless sense is: portion of what?, the same bayes rule
  on p(ai | b) makes sense in those terms. Viewed from the tree you are trying to measure the portion of
  ai that is in b.

* Independence =! disjoint. infact disjoint is dependence because intuitively it makes us change the beliefs.

* Independence on a single experiment by definition is just a numerical accident where p(a intersection b) =
  p(a) * p(b).

* It makes more sense across events from different experiments.

* With random variables we are basically scaling the concept of uncertainty.
  Most of the operations like independence, conditioning are same, just that 
  the scale has changed. Now it is across different universes/same universe
  but randomness in the variables. 

* random variable nomenclature makes sense if you see it as randomness or the  
  uncertainty across a variable. When you say two variables are independent, 
  you are saying that not just one but all the events under them are independent.
  Same with conditioning, the scale encompasses all the values that the variables
  can take. so conditioning can also be broken down into multiple eventful parts 
  which is our foundation.

* The notation helps manage the scale that we are talking about.
