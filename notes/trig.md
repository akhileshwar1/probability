## Trigonometry fundamentals.

* Firstly we work with right triangles and see that certain ratios are obeyed even with bigger or smaller triangles.
  We give them names as sin, cos, tan etc.

* Secondly, we scale the triangle down to have the hypotenuse as 1 by dividing all the sides by 1.

* And then we place that unit triangle on the coordinate axis. The scaled triangle now has x component
  as cos and y component as sin.

* Physically, all the possible triangles with different angles can be cooked up in the first quadrant.
  But all the possible triangles in terms of the coordinate axis needs the hypotenuse to be at different
  points on the unit circle.

* We just drop the straight line from the hypotenuse to the axis beneath it. Specially look for angles > 90.

* The convention has clokwise angles as negative.

* the computed values for some configurations like 60, 30 come from the equilateral triangle and the pythogoras theorem.

* radians is the distance on the curve of the circle. the total perimeter for the unit circle is 2*pi = 180 deg.

* tan measures the tangent line's intersection to the axis. cot is the remaining half of the line intersecting on the other axis.
