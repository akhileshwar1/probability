## Trigonometry fundamentals.

* Firstly we work with right triangles and see that certain ratios are obeyed even with bigger or smaller triangles.
  We give them names as sin, cos, tan etc.

* Secondly, we scale the triangle down to have the hypotenuse as 1 by dividing all the sides by 1.

* And then we place that unit triangle on the coordinate axis. The scaled triangle now has x component
  as cos and y component as sin.

* Physically, all the possible triangles with different angles can be cooked up in the first quadrant.
  But all the possible triangles in terms of the coordinate axis needs the hypotenuse to be at different
  points on the unit circle.

* We just drop the straight line from the hypotenuse to the axis beneath it. Specially look for angles > 90.

* The convention has clokwise angles as negative.

* the computed values for some configurations like 60, 30 come from the equilateral triangle and the pythogoras theorem.

* radians is the distance on the curve of the circle. the total perimeter for the unit circle is 2*pi = 180 deg.

* tan measures the tangent line's intersection to the axis. cot is the remaining half of the line intersecting on the other axis.

* Go to paul's notes or 3b1b playlist.

* The common question is how does it make sense to have a triangle for an obtuse angle. You see that when moving about
  the coordinate axis it is not about the triangle containing the obtuse angle because it just can't, instead it is 
  about triangle that is formed at that angle. Refer point 5 on how to form it there.

* when you say something like 2sin(x) you are scaling on the y axis by 2. what do you mean by scaling by?
  it basically means that you replace the scale that you have with unit distances in between with a scale
  that now has 2 unit distances in between points. SO in a way you stretch the graph.

* Similarly, on the x axis scaling such as sin(2x) things get squeezed along the x axis because 
  you have now replaced the x axis with a scale that has 2 unit distances between points, so things
  occur before.
